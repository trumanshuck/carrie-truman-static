</div><h1>Getting In A Bit Early</h1><div>After two long days and after-dark arrivals, Carrie and I decided to drive more or less straight from Albuquerque to Dolan Springs -- about seven hours.&nbsp; We start our drives each day with an extremely holy ritual, which reminds me that I should mention:<br><br><strong>"500 Miles" by the Proclaimers listen count:&nbsp; 4.</strong><br><br>The secret is to listen through to the following track until it just begins the <em>dun dun dun dunna dunna dun dun</em> so as to feel connected continuously through the Proclaimers' earnest warbling as it exists through time, and space, and our flickering souls.&nbsp; You may have thought that our coming marriage was the common thread that we pull through each of our days' experience, but I must beg to differ.&nbsp; Carrie is much less enthusiastic about this idea than I am, but I'm slowly warming her up to the call-and-response <em>duh duh luh dah</em> sung throughout.&nbsp; The secret, if you listen closely near the end, is the elongated beginning <em>duuuuh</em> in the final call.&nbsp; It's important to get this right.<br><br>I know, also, that the song is officially titled "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" in case you were rushing to point that out to me.&nbsp; I don't -- as a true-to-the-heart fan might say -- care.<br><br>Uh, anyway. It was a bright and beautiful morning when we set out from Casa Canoncito in Albuquerque.&nbsp; Carrie soothed her stomach with oats and the almost-always-effective distraction of birds.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSJXZ2lkOi8vYW4tZXZlbnQvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi8yM2Y2OGVmNC01ZmI1LTRlNTYtODc5Yi1mYmNlMWU5ZmQ4NDg_ZXhwaXJlc19pbgY7AFRJIgxwdXJwb3NlBjsAVEkiD2F0dGFjaGFibGUGOwBUSSIPZXhwaXJlc19hdAY7AFQw--c10833d67f1a50ebf56a8b5f7456076cbde65e4a" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.carrie-truman.fyi/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWt5TTJZMk9HVm1OQzAxWm1JMUxUUmxOVFl0T0RjNVlpMW1ZbU5sTVdVNVptUTRORGdHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--12928b7dbcb2f866ada2cc381dd4e4f69fe6b349/IMG_2441.jpg" filename="IMG_2441.jpg" filesize="154819" width="640" height="480" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="playing the age old &quot;where'd that bird go?!&quot; game"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpg">

</div><h1>Flagstaff</h1><div>
<br>We were about thirty minutes into our journey when Bryan, our incredibly kind Albuquerque host, messaged to let us know that we'd forgotten a titanium spork (this is a real thing that we own) in their sink.&nbsp; Bryan offered to mail it ahead to us, but we figured the timing wouldn't work too well and donated it to their household instead.&nbsp; Fortunately there's an REI in Flagstaff and we figured we'd drop by, and so set out on the highway.<br><br>"In 1000 feet, merge onto highway 40.&nbsp; Continue for four hundred sixty miles."&nbsp; Thanks for the heads-up on what we're doing today, map robot.<br><br>Although I don't really want to live in the southwest -- and for more reasons than the threat of glow-under-blacklight (so terrifying!) scorpions -- I love the scenery as we're driving.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSJXZ2lkOi8vYW4tZXZlbnQvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi8yYTI5N2EzYS04Nzk3LTQ5NzctYTgyNy03YmNkYWJiYTUwN2E_ZXhwaXJlc19pbgY7AFRJIgxwdXJwb3NlBjsAVEkiD2F0dGFjaGFibGUGOwBUSSIPZXhwaXJlc19hdAY7AFQw--5ba171a3b4a703842f707a7d3472afcab830600f" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.carrie-truman.fyi/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWt5WVRJNU4yRXpZUzA0TnprM0xUUTVOemN0WVRneU55MDNZbU5rWVdKaVlUVXdOMkVHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--d659c92bddb5df84a19050cc95c41832951dd4de/IMG_2754.jpg" filename="IMG_2754.jpg" filesize="80615" width="640" height="480" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="okay it's hard to tell but this is actually extremely beautiful"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpg">

</figure></action-text-attachment><br><br>Flagstaff was neat; we purchased a new titanium spork for backpack eating, bought a loaf of Dave's Killer Bread for on-the-road sandwiches (review:&nbsp; good sandwich bread, but killer?&nbsp; I may be showing my colors as a bread snob when I say "no."), and met a woman that grew up in Downer's Grove.&nbsp; It may be a small world, but our time in the car is indicating otherwise to Carrie and I.<br><br>
</div><h1>Loose Cows</h1><div>
<br>It was still light out as Carrie and I trundled in to Dolan Springs.&nbsp; A sign on the side of the road advised to keep on the lookout for "loose cows" in the road.&nbsp; Shortly after, the Rugged Prius began emitting a familiar scraping noise.&nbsp; I should mention at this point that between Chicago streets' speed humps and our sometimes inattention while driving quickly over Chicago streets' speed humps, our car's undercarriage was in rough shape.&nbsp; There's a large plastic shield down there that is currently held on with a collection of zip-ties.<br><br>This would mark the second time in our trip that we had to cut off a section of the plastic that had dipped too low.&nbsp; And so with a collection of loose cows looking onward, I got down in the dust with our small pocket knife and sawed off another bit of the car.<br><br>
</div><h1>Broken Arrow</h1><div>
<br>We were grateful to arrive at Broken Arrow with plenty of light left and enjoyed an evening that was several times longer, and many times more relaxing, than the fall-into-bed-fall-out-of-bed-into-the-car nights we'd enjoyed for the past few nights.&nbsp; The desert is gorgeous, and the stars are gorgeous, and the scorpions are terrifying.&nbsp; I'm watching you, tiny terrorbugs.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSJXZ2lkOi8vYW4tZXZlbnQvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi9lNWNkM2NmNy01NDQzLTQyZTItYTYzZS1kNWQwMjQ5YjdhNGM_ZXhwaXJlc19pbgY7AFRJIgxwdXJwb3NlBjsAVEkiD2F0dGFjaGFibGUGOwBUSSIPZXhwaXJlc19hdAY7AFQw--7f4a3a5946791317df086162515d80262ded5a21" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.carrie-truman.fyi/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWxsTldOa00yTm1OeTAxTkRRekxUUXlaVEl0WVRZelpTMWtOV1F3TWpRNVlqZGhOR01HT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--ce747e6cb1eaca1ce4a1af1bfe5baad41e8f3766/IMG_2763.jpg" filename="IMG_2763.jpg" filesize="139219" width="640" height="480" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="behind these smiling faces are the battle-sharpened minds of scorpion hunting warriors"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpg">
