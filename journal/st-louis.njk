  <h1>Joplin, MO</h1><div>
<br>Our first trip through Joplin, MO, saw us making a quick stop for Carrie's first Hardee's dinner.&nbsp; On our way back through we thought we'd try the jewel of Joplin, <a href="https://fredandredschili.com/">Fred &amp; Red Chili</a>.&nbsp; Folks rave about their "Spaghetti Red," but we wanted to get back on the road -- I (driving) got a cheeseburger and fries.&nbsp; Carrie figured she'd better try the chili and ordered a chili cheeseburger.&nbsp; We figured it'd be garnished with chili, but Fred &amp; Red does not skimp.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSJXZ2lkOi8vYW4tZXZlbnQvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi9jYzY1MWM1Yy1jNWZiLTQ1MDEtYjMyYS1jYWY3ODcxYzFiZDQ_ZXhwaXJlc19pbgY7AFRJIgxwdXJwb3NlBjsAVEkiD2F0dGFjaGFibGUGOwBUSSIPZXhwaXJlc19hdAY7AFQw--dd093e52589c05007fd4354b01a5c2334816327d" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.carrie-truman.fyi/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWxqWXpZMU1XTTFZeTFqTldaaUxUUTFNREV0WWpNeVlTMWpZV1kzT0RjeFl6RmlaRFFHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--87f899682ecb7aa55feffad0cecf82b713471022/IMG_3543.jpeg" filename="IMG_3543.jpeg" filesize="120025" width="640" height="480" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="The grand lake chili burger"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpeg">

</div><h1>Almost To St. Louis</h1><div>
<br>Growing up in nearby (-ish) Columbia, MO, I'd spent a fair amount of time visiting Lee Ann and her husband Bob and their three sons, Bobby, Logan, and Lucas, at their home outside of St. Louis.&nbsp; Lee Ann and Bob went to school with both of my parents at Rockhurst University (then College) in Kansas City, MO, and they've been great family friends since.<br><br>Lee Ann graciously offered to put us up, but Chicago's travel restrictions meant we'd have to stay at a no-contact bed and breakfast in order to ward off a fourteen day quarantine once we returned home.&nbsp; Instead, Lee Ann and Bob hosted us for a lovely dinner of St. Louis BBQ outside on their front drive.&nbsp; They were incredibly kind to have us; we had a great time and it was wonderful to see them and talk.&nbsp; I hadn't been back to their house since probably before high-school -- but I have memories of their swimming lake nearby, of lighting what must have been a 50' roll of firecrackers for the Fourth of July one year, of driving a go-kart around their subdivision, and of taking turns playing computer games with Bobby, Logan, and Lucas.&nbsp; Lee Ann also had some pictures of tiny-baby Truman.&nbsp; It's nice to be reminded just how cute I once was.<br><br>
</div><h1>St. Louis</h1><div>
<br>Carrie and I stayed at a well-appointed vacation rental via SF Shannon.&nbsp; We were mostly in-and-out since the next day would bring us home to Chicago.</div><div>
