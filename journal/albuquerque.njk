<br>I forgot to mention that, during our Grand Canyon backpacking, Carrie would stop and look around and proclaim (loudly) "it's the Graaaaaaaaand Canyon."&nbsp; On our way back up the Bright Angel trail we met a family while waiting on some mules to pass; they had two girls maybe eight and ten.&nbsp; The eight year old exclaimed, twice, "it's the Graaaaaaaaand Canyon" in almost the exact same voice.&nbsp; Don't ever say we've lost our childlike sense of wonder.<br><br>Carrie also got up early on the day following to take some sunrise shots before we left.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSJXZ2lkOi8vYW4tZXZlbnQvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi81ZDc2MWFhZS1hNTM5LTQwMmEtOTQ5Zi0wZWRiOGM3NjRiNTk_ZXhwaXJlc19pbgY7AFRJIgxwdXJwb3NlBjsAVEkiD2F0dGFjaGFibGUGOwBUSSIPZXhwaXJlc19hdAY7AFQw--d9525b281999abfbf274745dee86908aa03042f2" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.carrie-truman.fyi/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWsxWkRjMk1XRmhaUzFoTlRNNUxUUXdNbUV0T1RRNVppMHdaV1JpT0dNM05qUmlOVGtHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--c85fe6b00ee049229a1a25a0a5b5ed78a9e3fa33/IMG_3531.jpeg" filename="IMG_3531.jpeg" filesize="75637" width="640" height="360" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="The morning light is beautiful in the Graaaaaaaaand Canyon"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpeg">

</div><h1>Albuquerque</h1><div>
<br>It seems that lots of Albuquerque-ians prefer the ABQ abbreviation and I think it's because the city's name is a nightmare to spell.&nbsp; Anyway, in ABQ we had the pleasure of staying in another cute Airstream -- this one called Ernest -- at a place called <a href="https://www.stickyfingers-abq.com/">Sticky Fingers</a>.&nbsp; Alex (chef and art gallery curator) and Michael run the bed and breakfast, as well as a one-table private restaurant -- which is actually a members-only club with members-only restaurant for zoning purposes.&nbsp; Membership is one dollar per day.<br> <br>This was the single best meal (dinner) followed by the second best meal (breakfast the next day) that we had on the entire trip.&nbsp; Alex and Michael went out of their way to make the occasion special and prepared a beautiful broth fondue dinner for us.&nbsp; They also sell a variety of their food products, which Carrie and I bought to take with us on our trip.&nbsp; I cannot praise this place enough and we'll definitely be staying there the next day.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSJXZ2lkOi8vYW4tZXZlbnQvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi9iZjE2YTE3Mi1mNTM2LTQxMmUtODBkNi0yZDM4ZDhjOWZkZWQ_ZXhwaXJlc19pbgY7AFRJIgxwdXJwb3NlBjsAVEkiD2F0dGFjaGFibGUGOwBUSSIPZXhwaXJlc19hdAY7AFQw--6f6596d3d03b926cae204dc5f467d3360fd50510" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.carrie-truman.fyi/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWxpWmpFMllURTNNaTFtTlRNMkxUUXhNbVV0T0RCa05pMHlaRE00WkRoak9XWmtaV1FHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--41e76750cee02e6510e2258beb31076f71ad97c9/IMG_3535.jpeg" filename="IMG_3535.jpeg" filesize="129454" width="640" height="480" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="Dinner is on their patio by their koi pond.
