  <h1>Driving</h1><div>We'd originally planned to stop in Oklahoma City, but found a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/36132897?source_impression_id=p3_1602245522_FVQ5nmO%2BJ%2Bbws4tm">cute airbnb</a> in Bristow which is about an hour or so closer.&nbsp; Somehow an eleven hour drive really is much nicer than a twelve hour drive.&nbsp; We set out at eight from a sunny Chicago.<br><br>We took a fair number of car trips when we were young and for a while we really only listened to two things over and over -- "500 Miles" by the Proclaimers, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_O%27Callahan">story tapes by Jay O'Callahan</a>.&nbsp; I'm not sure which of those my mom or dad preferred less, but my brother and I are still alive today -- so repeated high-pitched calls of "Again!&nbsp; Again!" each time "500 Miles" ended were not enough to cause them to take the car violently off of the road and into whatever field of cows or crops was nearby.<br><br>My mom, Elisa, gave us two beautiful gifts:&nbsp; a couple of Jay O'Callahan CDs, and the perfect mixtape.&nbsp; We listened to the mixtape first.&nbsp; It contains fifteen tracks, and all of them are "500 Miles" by the Proclaimers.<br><br><strong>500 Miles Listen Count: 2</strong><br><br>We also listened to one of the Jay O'Callahan stories -- a two-disk piece called "Gouda."&nbsp; It was great, but I'm really excited for another, "Woe is me Bones."&nbsp; I can't find a preview, but it's <a href="https://www.ocallahan.com/listen-to-a-story">something like these</a>.<br><br>
