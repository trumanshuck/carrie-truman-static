  <h1>Almost Home</h1><div>
<br>On our way back through Illinois Carrie and I stopped to stretch our legs (and eat leftover BBQ sandwiches -- thanks again Lee Ann &amp; Bob!) at the Midewin Tallgrass Prairie.&nbsp; They have lots of grasses, and even a few bison (which we got to see!).&nbsp; It was a nice stop, but I was ready to be home.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSJXZ2lkOi8vYW4tZXZlbnQvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi8yOTdkMGZlZC1jYTc2LTQ5MTEtOTVhMS04YTc5MzgwNjQwMDM_ZXhwaXJlc19pbgY7AFRJIgxwdXJwb3NlBjsAVEkiD2F0dGFjaGFibGUGOwBUSSIPZXhwaXJlc19hdAY7AFQw--04d25166d6eee58d736cda3985fbc571bd6f9b4b" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.carrie-truman.fyi/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWt5T1Rka01HWmxaQzFqWVRjMkxUUTVNVEV0T1RWaE1TMDRZVGM1TXpnd05qUXdNRE1HT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--9fb4597d94d8a7500c675165d6bc318226145793/IMG_3545.jpeg" filename="IMG_3545.jpeg" filesize="144378" width="640" height="480" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="see?"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpeg">

</div><h1>Home</h1><div>
<br>We arrived back in Chicago around 4pm on Saturday, October 24th.&nbsp; Carrie is already planning at least our next two backpacking trips, but I was quite ready to unpack, pet our small orange cat gremlin, and relax.&nbsp; And that's about what I did until now, Monday evening, when I'm finally getting around to back-writing the remaining journal posts.&nbsp; We also did some photo organization and will be posting that album soon!<br><br>

<br>Thank you for your support.&nbsp; Thank you for helping make our trip possible.&nbsp; Thank you for all of the kind and funny words that you sent along.&nbsp; Thank you for your time and for your attention following our journal.&nbsp; This was an incredible, astounding trip for Carrie and for me; we would not be where we are, or who we are, without you.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>Love,<br><br>Truman (and Carrie)</div>

  <h1>After Returning Home</h1><div>
<br>I pulled out our candy-and-sweet-things basket in order to stow the remainder of our trip snacks while unpacking and you'll never guess what I saw, quietly tucked into the bottom:&nbsp; one bag of chocolate covered pretzels that I'd stashed and forgotten I'd placed there before our trip.<br><br>Sorry Tess.</div>
